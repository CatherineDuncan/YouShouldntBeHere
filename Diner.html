    <h3>The Diner feels warm. It is a strange warmth, like the damp and fallow stillness of a sick-room. It sticks to your nose, 
        in the back of your throat, reaching down into your lungs. The floor is sticky. The countertop is slick. Sitting on
        it is a folder. Your name is written on it in a hasty scrawl, with "For Your Immediate Consideration" written below.
        Inside is only an address. </h3>
